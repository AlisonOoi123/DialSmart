HOW TO UPLOAD homeWallpaper.jpg
================================

The hero section is currently using a blue gradient fallback because 
homeWallpaper.jpg is not found on the server.

To display your custom wallpaper image:

1. Copy your image file from Windows:
   C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\DialSmart\img\homeWallpaper.jpg

2. Upload it to the Linux server at:
   /home/user/DialSmart/app/static/images/homeWallpaper.jpg

3. You can use one of these methods:
   - SCP: scp homeWallpaper.jpg user@server:/home/user/DialSmart/app/static/images/
   - FTP/SFTP client
   - Git: Commit the image to the repository
   - Direct copy if you have server access

4. After uploading, refresh the page - the image should appear!

Current Status:
- Blue gradient shows as fallback when image is missing ✓
- Code is ready to use the image when uploaded ✓
- Overlay darkness: 30% (adjustable in CSS)
